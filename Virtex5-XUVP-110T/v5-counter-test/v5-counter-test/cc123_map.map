Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    32 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  32
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         32 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       31 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O5 output only:              30
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        31 out of 138,240    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                31

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           32
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of      32    0%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      32    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          32 out of      32  100%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        34 out of     640    5%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
