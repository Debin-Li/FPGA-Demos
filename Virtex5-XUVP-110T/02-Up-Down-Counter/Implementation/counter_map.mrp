      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        34 out of     640    5%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                        6 out of      34   17%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.29

Peak Memory Usage:  940 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  12 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   12 secs

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
