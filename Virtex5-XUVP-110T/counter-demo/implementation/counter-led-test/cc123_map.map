    Number used as logic:                       31 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O5 output only:              30
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           32
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of      32    0%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      32    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          32 out of      32  100%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
